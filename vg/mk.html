One of the activities that the maintenance staff needs regularly to perform on one Radio Telescope is the inspection of the Antenna Shutter.
The responsible of providing the inputs to the technical writer has transmitted the inputs below.
Could you please draft and transmit to us a draft of the procedure that would allow a clear planning and safe execution of this activity and that you would like to be reviewed before including it into the maintenance manual?
If there are any points you want to clarify with the technicians, please include them in a comment.



Inputs from the Technicians:

Duration of the activity: 42 minutes

Tools needed for the execution:  1 eye bolt M12, 1 cherry picker or equivalent, 2 fall prevention equipment, 1 brush (small), 1 vacuum cleaner, 1 plastic bag.


Description of the activity:
1.	I check that the wind speed is below 4m/s. In case it is I continue the execution.
2.	I approach the antenna and access the first main platform where the Antenna Control Unit (ACU) is located.
3.	From the ACU I command the antenna to move to the following position: Elevation axes to 2 degrees
4.	From ACU I command the closing of the Shutter
5.	I remove the power to the Shutter and to the drive system (Azimuth and Elevation axes motors).
6.	I move out of the antenna and move in to the cherry picker
7.	I fasten all the tools to the cherry picker in order to avoid accidental fall of tools into the reflector dish of the radio telescope.
8.	I fasten myself to the cherry picker with the first set of harness.
9.	With the cherry picker I reach the feed shutter (Figure 1) at an altitude from ground of about 14m.
10.	I install the eye bolt M12 (Figure 2) on the frame of the primary vertex hole and hook to the eye the second set of the harness.
11.	I care of not stepping on the delicate edges of the reflector panels or the inner carbon fiber structure.
12.	I move into the primary vertex hole and clean the area with brushes and vacuum cleaner. I place all the collected debris in the plastic bag.
13.	I perform a visual inspection of the feed shutter (Figure 3).
14.	I hook the first safety rope of the harness to the cherry picker and unhook the second safety rope from the eye bolt M12.
15.	I move out from the key hole and enter the cherry picker basket.
16.	I remove the M12 eye from the antenna structure.
17.	I move away the cherry picker from the primary vertex hole and I leave the cherry picker.
18.	I re-energize the drive system (Azimuth and Elevation axes motors) and the shutter of the antenna.
19.	I leave the antenna.
